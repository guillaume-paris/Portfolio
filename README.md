## Overview

Hi there ! I'm a Epitech student at the Nancy campus. I'm currently in my 3rd year of studies.
During my studies at Epitech, I learned C and C++ which allowed me to learn new technologies. 
I had the chance to do an internship of 6 months at PriceWaterhouseCoopers Luxembourg, which allowed me to learn about web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I've learned a lot of things during my internship, especially about React. I've also learned about the agile method, which I use in my own school projects.

I also made an part-time intership in Immopad, a company that develops property management solutions. I've also learned and practice my skills in Javascript, especially in Angular / AngularJS.

So with these experiences, I can claim to be a web developer. That's why I'm making my own portfolio, to practice on the technologies I know.
